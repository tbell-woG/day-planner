# About The Project
The purpose of this project was to create a simple calendar application within the web browser that would save the user's events for each hour of the day. This calendar application is ideal for the coding bootcamp student who needs help scheduling and balancing out school, homework time, and their personal life throughout the day. The calendar features several "time blocks" where the user can fill in their goal for each hour of the day. The hours are have past appear gray in the app. The present hour appears red and the future hours appear green.
